module Polysemy.Conc.Effect.Gate where

-- | A single-use synchronization point that blocks all consumers who called 'gate' until 'signal' is called.
--
-- The constructors are exported from [Polysemy.Conc.Gate]("Polysemy.Conc.Gate").

-- | Convenience alias for scoped 'Gate'.
type Gates =

-- | Run an action with a locally scoped 'Gate' effect.
--
-- This avoids a dependency on @'Embed' 'IO'@ in application logic while still allowing the effect to be scoped.
